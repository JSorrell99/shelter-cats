# shelter-cats
Looking at shelter cat data from Shelter Animals Count, the National Database
I worte a story last year about how my local shelter is overcrowed and I wanted to see what the data shows. 
I feel into a deep rabbit hole and decided to focus just on Minnesota and choose cats, becasue I love cats.
All and all Minnesota is a good place to be a cat, you have a high percentage chance of finding a fur-ever home.
